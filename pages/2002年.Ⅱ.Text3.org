* Could the bad old days of economic decline ^^be about to^^ return?
* Since OPEC agreed to supply-cuts in March, the price of crude oil has ^^jumped^^ to almost $26 a barrel, up from less than $10 last December.

* This ^^near-tripling^^ of oil prices calls up scary memories of the 1973 oil shock, when prices ^^quadrupled^^, and 1979-1980, when they also almost ^^tripled^^.
* Both previous shocks resulted in double-digit inflation and global economic decline.

* So where are the headlines warning of ^^gloom^^ and doom this time?
* The oil price was given another push up this week when Iraq suspended oil exports.
* Strengthening economic growth, at the same time as winter ^^grips^^ the northern hemisphere, could push the price higher still in the short term.

* Yet(然而) there are good(有说服力的,有充分根据的) reasons to expect the economic consequences now to be less severe than in the 1970s.
* In most countries the cost of crude oil now accounts for a smaller share of the price of petrol than it did in the 1970s
* In Europe, taxes account for up to four-fifths of the retail price, so even quite big changes in the price of crude have a more muted effect on ^^pump prices^^(汽油出泵的价格 引伸为汽油价格)
* Rich economies are also less dependent on oil than they were, and so less sensitive
to ^^swings^^ in the oil price.
* Energy ^^conservation^^, a shift to other fuels and a decline in the importance of heavy, energy-^^intensive^^ industries have reduced oil ^^consumption^^.
* Software, ^^consultancy^^ and mobile telephones use far less oil than steel or car production.
* For each dollar of GDP (in constant prices) rich economies now use nearly 50% less oil than in 1973.
* The OECD estimates in its latest Economic Outlook that, if oil prices averaged $22 a barrel for a full year, compared with $13 in 1998, this would increase the oil import bill in rich economies by only 0.25-0.5% of GDP.
* On the other hand, oil-importing emerging economies—to which heavy industry has shifted—have become more energy-intensive, and so could be more seriously squeezed.
